# Global-Temperatures-Project
Taking advantage of the Global_Temperatures_By_Major_City dataset, we perform basic EDA to locate a city of interest for analysing further its temperature history and 
predicting both yearly and monthly temperature figures. A detailed Time Series analysis including various methods for checking the existence of stationarity and applying series transformations if needed, using custom-made tools of differencing. Moreover, we measure and potentially mitigate aurocorrelation between the series lags by analysing ACF anf PACF plots and introducing AutoRegressive and MovingAverage parameters into a framework of ARIMA modelling, accordingly. The afforementioned process is divided into a yearly and monthly temperature investigation, for the purpose of which both a seasonal and a non-seasonal model is built. Throughout and after designing the models, we constantly analyse the behaviour of the residuals for staying alligned with the Gaussian context in which the model employement is taking place, using various plots and techniques for distribution analysis. Finally, metrics of assessment are developed, where along with standard criteria of evaluating time series forecasting accuracy, we establish a versatile landscape of reasoning for approving or not the relevant outcomes.

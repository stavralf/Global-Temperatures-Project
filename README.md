# Global-Temperatures-Project
Taking advantage of the Global_Temperatures_By_Major_City dataset, we perform basic EDA to locate a city of interest for analysing further its temperature history and 
predicting both yearly and monthly temperature figures. A detailed time-series analysis including various methods for checking the existence of stationarity and applying series transformations if needed, using custom-made tools of differencing. Moreover, we measure and potentially mitigate aurocorrelation between the time-series lags by creating and analysing ACF anf PACF plots and introducing AutoRegressive and MovingAverage parameters to a framework of ARIMA modelling, accordingly. The afforementioned process is divided into a yearly and monthly temperature investigation, for the purpose of which both a seasonal and a non-seasonal model is built. Throughout and after designing the models, we constantly analyse the behaviour of the residuals for staying alligned with the Gaussian context in which the model employement is taking place, using various plots and techniques for distribution analysis. Finally, specific metrics of assessment are developed, where along with standard criteria of evaluating time-series modelling, establish a
a versatile landscape of reasoning for approving or not the relevant outcomes.
